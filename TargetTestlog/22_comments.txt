[10:53:27]: Just right of the target
[10:56:18]: Using a little time to play with the kinect :)
[10:56:57]: Using overhand throw
[10:57:17]: The technique is done right and should count the first 
[10:57:36]: Just jumped out
[10:58:11]: Good throw apart from the system not recognizing as fast even though the technique is done right
[11:00:31]: Very good tilt push. The technique was spot on
[11:03:57]: the grab technique was performed correctly. The miss was due to aiming and should be counted as a miss.
[11:04:57]: Underhand throw pull
[11:05:32]: Just missed it right of the target :)
[11:08:28]: System error register
[11:08:38]: again
[11:08:47]: Couple of times there it look like the system registered a lock
[11:09:58]: Jumped
[11:10:08]: He mentions right away that it's hard to get the small targets
[11:10:45]: system tilt error
[11:10:55]: He mentions learning ability [I would assume he means getting familiar with how much force the phone needs to send/get shapes]
[11:12:28]: A bit of jitter. Doesn't seem to impact his ability to hit targets :)
