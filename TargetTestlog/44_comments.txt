[14:11:20]: Sometimes it takes a couple of extra seconds, because it has to register the pointing hand again
[14:12:06]: This adds extra time 
[14:12:13]: That looked like a system error
[14:14:43]: Looks liek a pretty god swipe push session :)
[14:15:59]: Aiming good but the pointer moved when he threw the shape
[14:16:55]: He'susing underhand throw for all the attempts
[14:17:36]: Good throw technique and aiming was precise
[14:19:44]: It jumped of the target area a couple of times but he was fast and general more precise with the tilt than most
[14:22:33]: Good pull throw
[14:23:33]: Practice system lock
[14:24:13]: System lock error
[14:25:47]: Did the technique very well
[14:26:25]: Only very frew system errors that locked the pointer
[14:27:50]: 100%. Very quick and efficient
[14:28:03]: Looks like he's moving the pointer towards the middle when he hit a target 
[14:29:16]: Jumps around when the tilt is perfoemed
[14:29:30]: Jumped down
[14:29:45]: Jumped down
[14:30:01]: Good tilt. Some errors but the tilt technique with the phone was good
