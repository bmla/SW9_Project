[09:58:48]: Push throw starting
[10:00:56]: Changing pointing arm
[10:01:08]: Missed the second to last one due to aiming
[10:04:06]: No problems with the grab push
[10:05:16]: The cursor jumps down
[10:05:28]: The pointer has been positioned on the target and the tilt is performed and the pointer will then jump down, up or to the sides.
[10:06:09]: He is doing better than most participants by the looks of it
[10:06:29]: Only missed a few 
[10:08:41]: Did great with the swipe
[10:12:44]: No issues with the throw pull either
[10:15:41]: No system errors. Didn't lock the pointer during the grab pull
[10:17:07]: The pointer jumes a little
[10:17:32]: Right jump
[10:17:40]: Small jump down
[10:17:51]: Some small jumps. But like I wrote earlier, it's small jumps after the pointer was centered on the target and the technique was performed
