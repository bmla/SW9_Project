[10:29:58]: recognized the technique as open hand while not intended
[10:31:54]: misunderstod the technique to start with (1-2 first attempts). Thought he had to grab with the pointing hand. This was corrected
[10:33:14]: The system didnt recognize the technique and then the pointing hand slided out of the target area
[10:35:08]: Participant feels that he has to stretch his arm way up to reach the to row
[10:38:12]: Participant thinks it feels a bit awkward
[10:39:05]: All tilt techniques were performed correctly. The missed targets were due to the pointer jumping when the phone was tilted
[10:40:29]: The technique is not performed as described in the demo
[10:40:53]: Participant uses the other hand (the one holding the phone) to touch the shape
[10:42:25]: Wrong shape ;)
[10:43:04]: Participant was very efficient with the pull throw technique
[10:44:31]: Participant feel good about the pull tilt technique
[10:44:55]: 
[10:46:02]: The hand gets in the way of the screen
[10:46:15]: Participant again have to raise the arm far to get to the outer parts of the screen
