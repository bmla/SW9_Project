[09:29:39]: 
[09:31:38]: push throw
[09:31:53]: big motion
[09:32:51]: overhand throw
[09:33:25]: Aiming just at the last moment. Looked like she had started the throw, but was slowing the throw down to aim and the following through with the throw 
[09:35:39]: There are some misses for that push tilt and at the end it seemed like she was getting faster and faster with the tilt
[09:36:46]: push swipe has started
[09:37:47]: the last one was a shape incorrect
[09:38:03]: But otherwise the swipe was good. Seemed like she was faster with the large targets. While at the same time more precise with the small targets but not as much with the large targets
[09:39:30]: push grab started
[09:39:58]: Faster with the large targets
[09:41:07]: pull swipe starting
[09:42:20]: most of the large targets the aim is not for the center but rather keeping up a good speed. And hitting targets as fast as possible. With the small targets it's obviously closer to the center
[09:43:32]: pull grab
[09:43:54]: 1 error
[09:45:11]: pull tilt starting in a moment
[09:45:49]: pull tilt starting
[09:47:07]: pull throw is next
[09:47:51]: againg overhand pull over the shouulder
[09:49:03]: No issues with the throw
