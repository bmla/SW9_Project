Pull Throw
Overhand pull
Little to no movement on the pointing hand when he performed the throw.

Push tilt
The aim at the center is good but jumps.
Sometimes not as much as could be the case.
Sometimes the activation (the registration of the tilt) happens before the jump and therefore the target turns green instead of red.

Push Throw
Fore one target it didn't want to register his throw, and seems like it frustrated him a bit, and the target was missed.

Push grab
Changed hands for the last couple of targets
Otherwise there were just a few problems grabbing the shape from the phone.

Push swipe
No problems
