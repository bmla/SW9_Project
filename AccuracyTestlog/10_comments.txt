push tilt
Some jumps with the pointer initially but he became more precise later

push throw
No errors during the throw.

push grab
No real issues once he understood the technique and knew that the hand had to be closed and then open

push swipe
no issues with the swipe

pull swipe
Aiming for the center while still trying to be fast (it seems)
1 error (wrong shape) for one of the last attempts (check video)

pull tilt
Aiming, which is good. When a corner target appears he doesn't just slide the pointer into the corner, some time is spent on aiming the pointer towards the center before activating the technique.

pull grab
Sometimes when the aim is perceft center, when the hand is closed it will jump slightly away from the center.

pull throw
no issues with this one :)
