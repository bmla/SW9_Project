pull throw
some jitter in the bottom right corner but noting that made her miss the target
otherwise, looked like a pretty good run at the pull throw

pull tilt
some jitter
pointer jumps 
the tilt is done correctly and the pointer is centered 

pull grab
locks in the practice
The technique is explained to her and now she understands the technique
the first couple of tries were performed the "easy way"
1 error
going more for speed than accuracy at the end there

pull swipe
just seeing some jitter with the pointer

push tilt
Approx. half way through she's doing a pull (sometimes)

push throw
underhand throw 
she's using a clearly detectable motion for the kinect. Swinging her arm backwards and then forward

push grab
The first two practice targets her hand was pinching with this pinch hand position that looks like an OK hand sign
jitter
Looks like it was the wrong shape

push swipe
Her initial aim for some targets is good but what happens is that her focus on the phone, and swiping the shape, makes the pointer move slightly. Still hitting the target but not compleatly on center.
